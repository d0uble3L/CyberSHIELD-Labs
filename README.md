- [Web Vulnerability Scanner](./web-vulnerability-scanner/). The `web-vulnerability-scanner.py` script is a simple cybersecurity tool that checks for common vulnerabilities in a given website by looking for exposed files and directories. This can be useful for basic cybersecurity checks.
- [Password Strength Checker](./password-strength-checker/). The `password-strength-checker.py` script evaluates the strength of a given password based on several criteria such as length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
