# Web Vulnerability Scanner

The `web-vulnerability-scanner.py` script is a simple cybersecurity tool that checks for common vulnerabilities in a given website by looking for exposed files and directories. This can be useful for basic cybersecurity checks.

## Features

- Checks for common files and directories that might be exposed on a website.
- Identifies files that are accessible or forbidden (might exist but are protected).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (or create a new file if you're not using a repository):

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/d0uble3L/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd web-vulnerability-scanner
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

2. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python3 web-vulnerability-scanner.py
    ```

3. Enter the base URL of the website you want to scan (e.g., `http://example.com`).

4. View the results as the script checks for common vulnerabilities.

## Example
